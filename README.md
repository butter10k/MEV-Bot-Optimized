## üéØ **HOW THE ULTRA-FAST BOT WORKS**

5. **Instant Trade Execution**: Executes trades with sub-second speed
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks positions and market conditions

## üõ°Ô∏è Private Key Protection

The bot automatically checks for private keys in:

- `wallet.json` file
- `.env` file

If any private keys are detected:
1. üö® Immediate Telegram alert sent to your chat
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning logged to console
3. üõë Bot automatically shuts down
4. üì± Multiple alerts sent to ensure visibility

## üí° Why WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY is Required

The sniper bot needs your private key because:

2. **Wallet Access**: To access your wallet and perform trading operations
3. **Balance Checking**: To verify you have enough SOL before starting
4. **Trading Operations**: To actually buy/sell tokens on Pump.fun

**This IS your private key** - it's required for the bot to function, but the bot will automatically detect if it's exposed and alert you via Telegram.
